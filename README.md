# MRI Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning

## Abstract
This repository contains the work for my undergraduate thesis (TCC) on the development of a Machine Learning model for detecting and diagnosing anomalies in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

## Repository Structure
- `thesis/`: Contains the thesis document and chapters.
- `data/`: Includes raw and processed MRI datasets.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and architecture diagrams.
- `presentations/`: Slides and posters used for the thesis defense.

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Preprocess the data: Run `scripts/preprocessing.py`.
3. Train the model: Run `scripts/model_training.py`.
4. Evaluate the model: Run `scripts/evaluation.py`.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
